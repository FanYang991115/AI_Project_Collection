# AI_Project_Collection

This repository is a collection of various AI projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills and experiences in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repo.

## 1. Connect Four AI

An AI-based implementation of the classic Connect Four game, using advanced search algorithms to create a challenging opponent for human players.

## 2. Automatic Image Colorization AI

A deep learning-based solution that automatically colorizes grayscale images, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate realistic colorized images.

## 3. Mathematical Symbol Recognition

A machine learning project that recognizes handwritten mathematical symbols, leveraging advanced image processing techniques and neural networks to accurately identify a wide range of mathematical symbols from input images.

## 4. RSNA Breast Cancer Detection

This project contains my code and approach to the RSNA Breast Cancer Detection competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect breast cancer from mammography images. More information about the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection).

## 5. Vesuvius Challenge: Ink Detection

My code to the Vesuvius Challenge: Ink Detection competition on Kaggle still ongoing, which aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting ink in historical documents. More information about the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection).
